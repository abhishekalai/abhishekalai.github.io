# Upcoming write-ups

As the blog description states, it's my DevLog and I'll be writing about my journey as a Software Engineer. My tenure at a startup has allowed me to be a part of several crucial and (at the time) mindbending projects. I also got to work with some brilliant minds at the same time! Below are the ones I'm most excited about:

- [x] Starting out on a single EC2 instance
- [ ] How we moved out from a single EC2 instance - Part 1 - Architectural Decisions & High level design
- [ ] How we moved out from a single EC2 instance - Part 2 - Implementation of the Backend
- [ ] How we moved out from a single EC2 instance - Part 3 - Implementation of the Build Pipelines
- [ ] Introducing Role Based Access Control in our Applications - Part 1 - Implementation in the Applications
- [ ] Introducing Role Based Access Control - Part 2 - Implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) with our office suite

The list is not exhaustive! ðŸ˜¬
